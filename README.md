Spendee Mobile Application
===========================
<pre>
We have created this mobile application moderating the theory of “Wealth Consumption” by Lord Buddha. From this app the user can get an idea of how to manage their income effectively. When user open the app, a pin will appear. This pin used for the safety of the app because this app has financial data. 
We have included four concepts in this mobile application.
      •	Expenses 
      •	Investment
      •	Saving
      •	Goal
First user click the setting and change the saving rate, investment rate, expenses rate and goal rate by adding percentage values as user want. Then user add monthly income amount and select the date and type something in the description box and save it. Then the income will divide in to these four concepts and it show the relevant amount. 
There is a Tool button. It contain 
      •	Currency converter (Demo only)
      •	Remind
      •	Report
When user click the Converter button user can convert his amount, Sri Lankan Rupees in to Dollars. 
If the user want a reminder on specific date and time user can click Remind button and select the date time option and save the message user want remind. So the remind will appears on the users screen on the specified day.
When user click Report button, user can see his amount of Investments, Savings, Expenses, and goal in the previous month. It can be viewed by a column chart.
